AI, Safety, and Prompt Engineering

Prompt Engineering
Expert-level experience designing structured prompts, system prompts, meta-prompts, and constrained instructions that maximize reliability and reduce hallucinations. Skilled in multi-step prompting, determinism, and safe behavioral shaping for production systems.

LLM Behavioral Evaluation
Builds evaluation harnesses that measure hallucination rate, drift, prompt sensitivity, sycophancy, refusal behavior, token dependency, and multi-run stability. Experienced with behavioral testing for GPT, Claude, and open models.

AI Safety and Alignment
Applies safety-first techniques including constrained generation, safe completion patterns, adversarial testing, refusal tuning, and ethical UX. PhD research focused on risk quantification, mitigation, and responsible AI deployment.

System Prompt Architecture
Authors system-level prompts defining behavioral rules, guardrails, constraints, limitations, and persona consistency for production applications.

Meta-Prompting and Synthetic Data
Develops meta-prompts for generating structured datasets, training examples, regression test suites, and behavioral variations for evaluation pipelines.

Failure Mode Analysis
Identifies root causes of LLM misbehavior including hallucinations, misalignment, refusal failures, over-agreeableness, and multi-step reasoning collapse. Skilled in isolating minimal reproduction cases.

Model Debugging and Incident Response
Handles LLM behavioral incidents by diagnosing issues, designing minimal test prompts, isolating model-layer vs prompt-layer causes, and implementing corrected prompt strategies.

Safety-Conscious UX
Designs interfaces that minimize coercion, preserve user agency, and emphasize transparency. Applies WCAG, ADA principles, and ethical UX patterns to all AI-assisted interactions.

Python for Evaluation
Builds scripts for batch evaluation, prompt-variant testing, automated analysis, and behavioral scoring based on OWASP, CVSS, and custom metrics.

Model Comparison and Benchmarking
Compares GPT, Claude, and open models across safety, helpfulness, refusal quality, accuracy, and prompt adherence.

Ethical AI and Risk Assessment
Applies fairness, transparency, and risk quantification principles to evaluate model behavior and ensure ethical deployment.
