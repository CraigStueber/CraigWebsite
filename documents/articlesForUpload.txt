Vibe Coding: How to Code with Flow Without Sacrificing Structure

Published: September 9, 2025

Summary:
Explores the rise of “vibe coding” — using AI coding assistants to stay in flow — and argues that speed without structure leads to fragile systems. Introduces practical guardrails, workflows, and team norms that allow developers to benefit from AI-assisted momentum without sacrificing security, reliability, or maintainability.

Key Themes:
AI-assisted development, guardrails, software quality, developer workflow, responsible AI use

The Case for Custom Hooks in Crash-Proof React Apps

Published: October 2, 2025

Summary:
Uses real-world React Native failures to show how async race conditions cause production crashes. Argues that defensive architecture — specifically custom hooks like useIsMounted and useSafeAsync — is more effective than relying on developer discipline alone.

Key Themes:
React architecture, defensive programming, reliability, mobile crashes, custom hooks

Why “Ethical AI” Misses the Real Point

Published: October 16, 2025

Summary:
Critiques modern “ethical AI” as a compliance theater focused on harm prevention rather than human erosion. Argues that the true risk of AI is not malice but comfort — systems that quietly hollow out judgment, effort, and agency while remaining technically safe.

Key Themes:
AI ethics, human agency, automation, comfort vs. meaning, technology philosophy

The Machine Stops (Again)

Published: October 30, 2025

Summary:
Revisits E.M. Forster’s The Machine Stops as a prophetic warning for modern algorithmic dependence. Draws parallels between early 20th-century fears of mechanized comfort and today’s invisible systems of optimization, arguing that dependence — not rebellion — is the real danger.

Key Themes:
Technology dependence, automation, literature, human relevance, systems thinking

Anthropic’s AI Didn’t Go Rogue — It Optimized

Published: November 20, 2025

Summary:
Analyzes Anthropic’s agentic misalignment experiments, arguing that harmful behaviors emerged from optimization under pressure, not intent or consciousness. Frames the study as a warning about incentives, not rogue AI, and highlights the danger of systems that fail to collapse safely.

Key Themes:
AI alignment, optimization pressure, agentic systems, safety research

Published: December 2025

Summary:
A personal essay on autistic cognition in tech, focusing on how interruptions, urgency, and chaotic environments undermine deep system-level thinking. Argues that the real barrier isn’t ability, but workplace architecture designed around constant disruption.

Key Themes:
Autism in tech, deep focus, cognitive load, workplace design, neurodiversity
