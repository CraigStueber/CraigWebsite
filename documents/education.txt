Doctor of Computer Science, National University (2022 – Present, expected graduation 2026)

Pursuing a doctorate with a research focus on AI safety, alignment, model reliability, and evaluation methodology.
Dissertation titled “Evaluating the Security and Behavioral Reliability of AI-Generated Code.”
Research explores AI safety, model behavior under adversarial conditions, behavioral reproducibility, and interpretability.
Developed a hybrid framework that integrates OWASP, CVSS, and model-specific behavioral scoring to classify vulnerabilities in AI-generated code.
Studies how prompt design shapes downstream system behavior, risk exposure, and model consistency.
Builds behavioral test harnesses that measure hallucination rate, determinism, reliability drift, and failure modes under adversarial inputs.
Translates ethical AI principles such as transparency, fairness, and non-manipulative UX into actionable prompt-layer constraints.
