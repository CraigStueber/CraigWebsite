  "canonical_thesis": "The central risk of the AI age is not domination or rebellion, but displacement. As automation removes friction from daily life, it quietly erodes the cognitive and emotional capacities that effort once built—memory, judgment, curiosity, creativity, identity, and agency. The danger is not hostile AI, but a world where thinking becomes optional and human participation fades without resistance.",
