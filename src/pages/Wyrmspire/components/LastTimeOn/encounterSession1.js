    title: "Encounter 1: Bone Scrapers",
    description:
      "Lurking just beyond the torchlight, the Bone Scrapers are malformed skeletal scavengers pieced together from human remains, jagged tools, and broken weapons. They crawl with unnatural speed, metal claws scraping the stone. Their skulls are half-shattered, whispering fragmented prayers in Dwarven as they attack with desperation and rage.",

    title: "Encounter 2.A: Blighted Stirges",
    description:
      "These grotesque, winged monstrosities are far more than simple cave stirges. Their bloated bodies pulse with sickly green corruption, and their spiny legs twitch uncontrollably as they swarm their prey. With a sickening screech, they drive their barbed proboscises into flesh, draining blood and infecting wounds with a magical blight.",

    title: "Encounter 2.B: Wriggling Husk",
    description:
      "Once a humanoid, now a rotting sack of filth and parasites, the Wriggling Husk is a shambling mound of decay. Its swollen body convulses with the movement of internal worms, and the stench is overwhelming. When provoked, it swells and bursts in a violent spray of acidic bile and crawling horrors.",

    title: "Encounter 3: Bone Forged Horror",
    description:
      "Standing twice the height of a man and built from countless bones fused with rusted armor, the Bone Forged Horror is a monstrous sentinel left behind in the collapsed sanctum. Its glowing red eyes burn with unnatural hate, and its every movement sends a wave of fear through the cavern. When it strikes, it strikes to kill.",
