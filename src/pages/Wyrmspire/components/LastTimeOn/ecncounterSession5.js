    title: "Encounter 1: The Chapel of Silent Devotion",
    description:
      "The ruined chapel hums with a quiet, dreadful reverence. Shattered pews line the floor, gold filigree still clinging to cracked stone, and faded banners whisper of a forgotten faith. At the altar, three ghostly women in flowing silk robes sing a haunting, wordless hymn — arms raised, faces lifted in eerie devotion. Before them sit six unmoving skeletons, weapons resting across their knees like worshippers locked in eternal prayer. The air is thick with incense and decay, and the melody seems to press against your soul, as if the room itself remembers what it once was… and demands you remember, too.",

    title: "Encounter 2: The Undying Shieldwall ",
    description:
      "The chamber trembles with the echo of a long-dead command — “Hold the line!” Four skeletal soldiers rise in formation, shields locked and long spears braced, their bones etched with battle scars and rigid discipline. Behind them stands their commander: an undead elven woman clad in tarnished but once-exquisite armor, her hollow eyes burning with purpose. Though her skin is drawn tight over bone, her stance is noble, defiant — a general who never surrendered. The air is charged with old magic and older fury, as if the fight they died in never truly ended… and you're the next chapter in their war.",
