    description:
      "A massive elk towers above the forest floor, its antlers crowned in moss and mushrooms, its eyes clouded with unnatural calm. Every step it takes leaves the ground blooming — then rotting. This is no beast of nature, but a corrupted guardian. When threatened, it charges with terrifying speed, lashing out with vine-wrapped hooves and spore-laced breath.",

    title: "Encounter 2: Fungus-Bound Remains",
    description:
      "Half-buried in the mulch of a sunless glade, a human corpse in rotted cult robes lies unnaturally still. Fungal threads bloom from its sockets, spine, and fingertips. The body is long dead — but when approached, the fungus reacts. Whether as a warning, a trap, or a message, something ancient has rooted itself inside what once was a man.",
