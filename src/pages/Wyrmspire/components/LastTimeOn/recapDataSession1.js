    title: "1. A Funeral, A Favor, and a Flicker of Magic",
    description:
      "As the townsfolk gather to honor the late Tilda Braestone, Hemlock’s lantern reveals a magical presence around the sealed casket—though its nature eludes him. Meanwhile, Rose confronts a mysterious stranger watching the crowd. She scares him off with a quick Mage Hand—though not before making it clear he now owes her a favor. The pendant found on Tilda’s body is entrusted to Dimitri, and Ol’Iggy shares a quiet, heartfelt moment with Tilda’s grieving nephew.",

    title: "2. Rose’s Not-So-Sneaky Side Quest",
    description:
      "Just inside the mine, Rose finds a lockbox and tries to cast a Minor Illusion to distract the party. Unfortunately, her sleight of hand is not so minor—and everyone catches her in the act. When Hemlock questions her, she snaps: “It is a lady thing and leave me alone.” The group, already unsettled by the darkness around them, moves forward with unease and side-eye.",

    title: "3. The Pickaxe and the Prayers",
    description:
      "In the first combat, the party tears through a nest of Bone Scrapers with surprising ease. While searching the tunnel afterward, Ol’Iggy discovers Tilda’s lost pickaxe. It’s whispering Dwarven prayers. Rolling poorly to understand it, Iggy instead starts talking to it like it is Tilda. He repairs it with magic from his belt buckle, and in a rare, somber moment—the pickaxe simply says: “Thank you.”",

    title: "4. Shaft Drama",
    description:
      "The group arrives at the broken lift shaft and debates how to descend. Rose opts for style, bouncing effortlessly back and forth down the walls like a circus gymnast. Hemlock attempts the same. It does not go well. With a cry and a thud, he slams into the muddy cavern below—wet, bruised, and considerably less stylish.",

  {
    title: "5. The Bug and the Blob",
    description:
      "In the second encounter, Ol’Iggy charges toward a single flying bug while the rest of the group stares at a twitching, bloated corpse—the Wriggling Husk. It lurches to life and the real fight begins. While Iggy plays whack-a-mosquito, the party handles the horror.",

  {
    title: "6. Boom Goes the Bug",
    description:
      "As the Wriggling Husk begins to pulse and swell, the party prepares to retreat—except Rose. She charges in and delivers the killing blow. The corpse explodes violently in a spray of acidic bile… right into Dimitri’s face. Acid burns, victory stings, and no one is feeling very celebratory.",

  {
    title: "7. The Horror in the Water",
    description:
      "Just as the party catches their breath, the Boneforged Horror rises from the pool in the collapsed sanctum. The creature knocks Ol’Iggy out cold, but the team pulls together to bring it down. In the aftermath, they recover a scorched journal page, a map to a distant archive, and a fragment of a broken rune—the first real clue in a much larger mystery.",

  {
    title: "8. The Vision and the Pact",
    description:
      "As the room goes quiet, the pendant flares with blinding light. The group is pulled into a shared vision: a mountain, a god-sized dragon chained by glowing runes, and a voice in their own mouths: “The pact is broken. One is lost. Four remain.” Then it all snaps back—and the party, changed forever, levels up to 4.",
