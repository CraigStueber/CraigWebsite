    title: "1. A Funeral, A Favor, and a Flicker of Magic",
    description:
      "As the village of Wyrmspire mourns Tilda Braestone, Hemlock’s enchanted necklace flares faintly—revealing a hidden magical aura around the casket, though its purpose remains unclear. Among the mourners, Rose spots a cloaked stranger at the edge of the crowd. When she reaches out with a Mage Hand, the figure shudders slightly and slips away—but not before she confronts him. Later, after the mine collapse, Revan calls for volunteers to investigate. Before Rose can slip off, a different stranger—Bale, a sly-eyed man with a crooked smile—leans in and mutters, “Thought you were good at finding truth. Or is that just in beds?” She freezes, then smirks. He’s baiting her, but also making an offer. Begrudgingly, she agrees to descend with the others—after all, now he owes her a favor. Meanwhile, Dimitri receives the pendant recovered from Tilda’s body, and Ol’Iggy takes a quiet moment to speak with her trembling nephew before the group heads for the mine.",

    description:
      "Just inside the mine, Rose finds a lockbox and tries to cast a Minor Illusion to distract the party. Unfortunately, her sleight of hand is not so minor—and everyone catches her in the act. When Hemlock questions her, she snaps: “It is a lady thing and leave me alone.” The group, already unsettled by the darkness around them, moves forward with unease and side-eye.",

    title: "3. The Pickaxe and the Prayers",
    description:
      "In the first combat, the party tears through a nest of Bone Scrapers with surprising ease. While searching the tunnel afterward, Ol’Iggy discovers Tilda’s lost pickaxe. It’s whispering Dwarven prayers. Rolling poorly to understand it, Iggy instead starts talking to it like it is Tilda. He repairs it with magic from his belt buckle, and in a rare, somber moment—the pickaxe simply says: “Thank you.”",

    title: "4. Shaft Drama",
    description:
      "The group arrives at the broken lift shaft and debates how to descend. Rose opts for style, bouncing effortlessly back and forth down the walls like a circus gymnast. Hemlock attempts the same. It does not go well. With a cry and a thud, he slams into the muddy cavern below—wet, bruised, and considerably less stylish.",

The corpse explodes violently in a spray of acidic bile… right into Dimitri’s face. Acid burns, victory stings, and Dimitri is not feeling very celebratory.",

      "Just as the party catches their breath, the Boneforged Horror rises from the pool in the collapsed sanctum. The creature knocks Ol’Iggy out cold, but the team pulls together to bring it down. In the aftermath, they recover a scorched journal page, a map to a distant archive, and a fragment of a broken rune—the first real clue in a much larger mystery.",

      "As the room goes quiet, the pendant flares with blinding light. The group is pulled into a shared vision: a mountain, a god-sized dragon chained by glowing runes, and a voice in their own mouths: “The pact is broken. One is lost. Four remain.” Then it all snaps back—and the party, changed forever, levels up to 4.",

During their absence, a brilliant green flame descended from the sky, making the mountains glow as if ablaze. The terrifying sight led to the mines being shut and most of Braeforge's citizens fleeing, leaving behind only the very young, elderly, and poor. For the entire three months, the town's air shimmered with a green tint. The flame lifted the moment the party’s vision ended.",
