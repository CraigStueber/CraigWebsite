      "Deep within Khar Grunn, the party discovers a pristine golden door untouched by time, gleaming with allure. The air is still, almost reverent.

    description:
      "This towering mushroom monstrosity appeared in the heart of a ruined chamber. With limbs like twisted roots, fungal tendrils pulsing with alien light, and a head of overlapping caps that peel back to reveal gnashing teeth, the False Spore Titan is a guardian of rot and forgotten spores. After a brutal fight, it crumbles into dust — as though it had existed outside of time itself.",
