    title: "Ankaran the Steadfast",
    description:
      "Ankaran the Steadfast stands like a living monument of ancient divinity — an elephant god from a race that once roamed the northern plains millions of years ago, long before men or dwarves shaped kingdoms. His enormous frame gleams with faint silver scars from forgotten wars, and his jade eyes hold the weight of eras gone by. Where his feet touch the earth, grass sprouts instantly, and the air hums with quiet peace. Once, he was mortal — a warrior who stood against the God Dragon’s first rise with nothing but his courage and will. Though he fell that day, the Father God himself raised him again, reforged in divine light, and named him Ankaran the Steadfast: eternal protector of the Elves of the Virelin Dominion. Over millennia, he has grown into one of the most powerful of the minor gods — gentle and wise, yet unmatched in strength. Upon his back rests a sword of glowing jade, gifted by the Father God, said to sing when near true evil. When the God Dragon rose a second time, Ankaran led the charge of the gods, holding the beast long enough for the Wyrmgates to be sealed. Now, he dwells beside the Elven Gate — the keystone of them all — standing watch over the Dominion and the balance of the world. Kind, patient, and a sworn vegan, Ankaran’s mercy is vast… but to those who bring violence to his realm, his wrath is as unstoppable as an earthquake.",

    title: "The Ballad of Two-Socks Vale",
    description: `Hear now, ye drunkards and dreamers bold,
Of Roder Vale, once proud and gold,
The eldest son of a knightly line,
Whose helm did gleam, whose lance did shine.

In youth he rode where banners streamed,
A jousting star, the kingdom’s dream.
But wine was sweet and powder fine—
He loved them both more than the divine.

The eve before his greatest test,
He drank his pride, forgot the rest.
“By dawn,” he roared, “I’ll claim my fame!
No horse alive shall match my name!”

He staggered forth through moonlit streets,
With drunken breath and clumsy feet.
His rival’s steed, he swore to take—
But fate, that night, would make him quake.

For in the noble’s yard there stood,
A stuffed parade horse, carved of wood.
Its wheels still gleamed, its eyes were glass—
Yet Roder thought, “This beast has class!”

He hauled it off, by rope and pride,
Through muddy ruts five miles wide.
Then, come the dawn, he cried, “Prepare!
I ride the steed beyond compare!”

The trumpets blew, the crowd did shout—
And Roder Vale came swaggering out.
In helm of gold and naught but socks,
He mounted up and called, “Unbox!”

He charged ahead—oh gods, what sight!—
A naked knight in morning light.
He bounced upon the wheeled display,
And yelled, “For glory! Huzzah! Hooray!”

The wooden beast refused to run,
But Roder thought the race was won.
He tipped his helm, he cheered, he bowed,
While gasps and laughter shook the crowd.

Then silence fell, then came the jeers,
That echoed down through sober years.
“Behold!” they cried, “the champion fails—
The mighty Sir of Wooden Tails!”

From that day forth, by tavern flame,
No bard would sing his real name.
They called him Two-Socks, brave yet frail—
The fool, the myth, the naked Vale.

Now he roams the roads in shame,
Haunted by his wooden claim.
He robs the rich, avoids parades,
And curses steeds in all their shades.

Yet somewhere still, by moonlight’s glow,
A whisper drifts where drunkards go:
“Raise your mugs, and never wail—
For none rode prouder than Two-Socks Vale.”`,
