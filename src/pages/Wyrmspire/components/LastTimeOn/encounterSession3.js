    description:
      "Sir Cedric DuVayne is a timeless noble whose charm masks something far darker. Though he hasn’t aged in decades, he remains elegant, polite—and unmistakably undead. His estate is lush, his servants unsettling, and his Parth Trees bleed sap touched by shadow.",

    title: "The Red-Robed Servants",
    description:
      "Clad in crimson robes, Sir Cedric’s servants move with stiff, unnatural jerks—dragging their feet like marionettes on splintered strings. Silent and obedient until provoked, they become snarling savages when their robes are removed, revealing pale, starved bodies twisted by recent vampirism.",
